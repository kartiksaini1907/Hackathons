Judges, to access the chatbot, you must upload your own gemini api key. The steps to do so are-
1. Download the ZIP file of the project from here
2. Use the cd command to navigate into the VoteWise---Team-Truth-Trackers folder (e.g., cd path/to/VoteWise---Team-Truth-Trackers)
3. Install dependencies using npm install
4. create a file named .env (exactly that, starting with a dot) in the root of the project folder (at the same level as server.js)
5. Inside that .env file, they will paste their own Google Gemini API Key: GEMINI_API_KEY = YOUR_OWN_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
6. Start the server using node server.js command
7. ENJOY!

*I am assuming that you have node.js installed
